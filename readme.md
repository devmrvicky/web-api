## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a variety of web APIs that cover different aspects of web development. These APIs are designed to demonstrate best practices and provide you with real-world examples that you can use as a reference in your own projects.

## API List

Here is a list of web APIs available in this repository:

1. [ Background task api ](./Background-tasks-api/): Background Task API (requestIdleCallback) schedules and executes tasks during browser idle periods for improved performance.
2. [ Battery api ](./Battery-api/): The Battery API allows you to access important battery-related information for a user's device, such as battery level, charging status, and estimated time until the battery is empty.
