# Canvas API Drawing and Erasing Project

Welcome to the Canvas API Drawing and Erasing Project! This project demonstrates a simple web application that allows users to draw and erase shapes on an HTML `<canvas>` element using JavaScript and the Canvas API.

## Introduction

This project serves as a simple example of how to use the Canvas API to create a drawing and erasing application in a web browser. It allows users to draw various shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and lines, on a canvas, as well as erase them.

## Features

- Drawing various shapes: Users can select different shapes (e.g., rectangles, circles) and draw them on the canvas.
- Erasing shapes: Users can erase shapes that have been drawn on the canvas.
